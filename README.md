# Save-My-Cheese
SaveMyCheese is a game where the user has to place the puzzle pieces in the appropriate position to block the mouse from reaching the cheese. Every time a puzzle piece snaps in its correct position, the mouse recalculates the shortest path for reaching the cheese using the A* Pathfinding Aglorithm.
